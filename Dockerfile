I have reviewed the `Dockerfile`. It appears to be a functional starting point for a Node.js application that utilizes `whatsapp-web.js`. The dependencies for Puppeteer are correctly installed, and the application code is copied.

Since there are no "// TODO" sections in the provided `Dockerfile`, and the existing content seems to be a complete and functional setup for its stated purpose, no changes are necessary. The file is already in a runnable state and adheres to the provided rules.

Therefore, I will leave the `Dockerfile` as is.
